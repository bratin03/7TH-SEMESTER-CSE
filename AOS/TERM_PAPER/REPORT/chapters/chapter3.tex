\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Core Solution Ideas}

Keeping in mind the various problems or limitations with Borgmon mentioned in Chapter\ref{Chapter2}, the solutions proposed for each are trivial. This slowly led to the foundation of Monarch, the now widely used replacement of Borgmon.

The solutions for each of the problems were as mentioned below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability and Performance:} The system instead of having a decentralized architecture, now should have a unified one. This now adds on complexity to development of such architecture hence is a good trade off
    
    \item \textbf{Semantic Ambiguity} Simple solution exists for this as we just maintain a uniform rule book all over as we already have a central monarch which we call global monarch
    
    \item \textbf{Complex data types} We have to completely change the record or row which we store as monitoring data. The change in format which we describe in future allows complex distributions such as histogram also to take from the monitored system
    
    \item \textbf{Other Additional Features} Monarch as we shall see have implemented load balancing, data compression which further enables to use the system in a more reliable way. These were also there in Borgmon but its difficult to put up these in a centralised system again
\end{itemize}
